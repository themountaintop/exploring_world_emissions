### Overview of project
Our team has decided to take a deeper look into the correlation found between global emissions, population, and temperatures using machine learning to formulate classes and predictions to create visualizations. 

### Project notes

#### Segment 1
 
  For this segment we have cleaned the data, created tables for our database which we have saved as CSV files (listed below), and individually commited to our branches of the repo before merging.

  The team selected datasets concerning emissions by country, global temperature trends, and world population. We all agreed that we would like something measureable and scientific to work on for our project. We wanted a subject we all cared about that would also be an interesting subject to present. (Also, the Star Wars data we found didn't have any data to show off our machine learning skills!) We plan to use this data to show trends over the last 5-10 years whether it be an increase or decrease of emissions.

#### Segment 1 Challenges:

The data we selected seems to have come from different sources that had different objectives, so we had some trouble cleaning the data in a way that allowed us to join the tables on the country and year of collection. 

The data set we selected went back to the 18th century, and as a group we had to decide what we would keep and what we would drop. This also helped in creating the initial database.
