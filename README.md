### Overview of project
Our team has decided to take a deeper look into the correlation found between global emissions, population, and temperatures using machine learning to formulate classes and predictions to create visualizations. 

### Resources
Source Data:

- [Temperature Trends](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-land-and-surface-temperature-trends-analy?select=GlobalTemperatures.csv)
  - this data set covers temperature changes
  - cleaned data was saved into a new table

- [World population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)
  - this data set includes world population
  - cleaned data was saved into a new table
  
- [Emissions by Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022)
  - this data set has our emissions measrements by country
  - cleaned data was saved into a new table
